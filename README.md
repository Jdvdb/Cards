iOS app to help you study for school!

Note about repo status:

This project was started back in the summer (i.e. before GitHub made changes from master to main) and was not pushed to a repo until recently.

Because of that there are some issues to work out to get the code onto main. For now, you can find all of the code in the main branch.

Also be aware that this app is not yet finished. Most of the screens have been created and it has most functionality but there are still a few bugs present.

I hope you enjoy :)

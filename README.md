# Cards

A simple way to create cue cards on your iOS devices.

Note that this app is a very rough PoC designed out of curiosity. There are still bugs within it along with some poor UX/UI formatting.

## Features

* Create folders for different classes that you have.
* Create study sets of notes within these classes.
* Within each set of notes, create cue cards that you can read from and review.
